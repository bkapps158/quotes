Live life with attitude.I wear my attitude like a crown.I've got a fierce attitude and I'm not afraid to show it.My attitude is everything.Beauty is only skin deep. Attitude is down to the bone.I don't let anyone dull my shine or dampen my attitude.I've got the right amount of sass and attitude to take on any challenge.I'm not afraid to let my attitude shine bright.My attitude is my superpower.Confidence is the best accessory.Don't chase people, attract them.May not be perfect, but always authentic.Not a second choice, the first option.Be yourself, and you can be anything.Don't be busy, be productive.Attitudes are more important than facts.Things won't get better unless you think better.Be smart, but never show it.
