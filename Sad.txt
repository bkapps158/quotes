<ul>
<li>A multitude of people, yet loneliness creeps.</li>
<li>And just like that, I’m forgotten.</li>
<li>All they notice are my mistakes.</li>
<li>Alone and ignored.</li>
<li>Am I sad? Not really, but I feel quite empty.</li>
<li>Because when I sleep, the feelings of sadness, anger, and loneliness cease to exist.</li>
<li>Cry, not when the sun has set, for the tears will hinder you from seeing the stars.</li>
<li>Everyone goes through phases and all, don’t they?</li>
<li>Feeling too much! Everything just goes straight to my heart.</li>
<li>Getting flashbacks suck when they’re memories that you’ve always wanted to forget.</li>
<li>Have you ever cried after keeping in all your feelings for so long?</li>
<li>I need a break from my own thoughts.</li>
<li>I’m not okay, but it’s okay.</li>
<li>I’m that one friend who’s forgotten.</li>
<li>Just because I can carry my troubles well doesn’t mean I don’t feel the crushing weight.</li>
<li>Let the tears come and water your soul.</li>
<li>Memories hurt.</li>
<li>My only wish right now is to fall asleep before I fall apart.</li>
<li>Neither friends nor enemies. Just strangers with some memories.</li>
<li>Never have I intended to give up on anyone. But there were some doleful times where I had to.</li>
<li>No more. I don’t want to think anymore.</li>
<li>No one cares anyway.</li>
<li>Nobody knows about the emotional breakdowns I experience when I’m alone. Everyone only knows about the smiles and laughs I show them.</li>
<li>Not broken. Just a muddle of everyone and everything I once knew.</li>
<li>Pain is hard to avoid. Actually, just the act trying to avoid it is already a pain.</li>
<li>People come, people go. In the end, it’s just you.</li>
<li>Pretending to be happy, hoping that the saying “fake it till you make it” actualizes.</li>
<li>Remember that pessimism isn’t really bad at all. People will disappoint you eventually, and you are going to do the same.</li>
<li>Slowly but surely, people stop reaching out. Then all of a sudden, you’re all alone.</li>
<li>Sobbing alone in some room, and then walking out like nothing ever happened.</li>
<li>Such is the cruelty of life! It often tries to get in the way of our dreams.</li>
<li>The only broken instrument that works is the heart.</li>
<li>Things change, and friends leave. Indeed, life stops for no one.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, being okay takes a lot of work.</li>
<li>What’s the point of it all?</li>
<li>Whenever happiness visits me, bad things happen right after. I’ve been afraid of happiness since then.</li>
<li>Wouldn’t it be terrific if we could turn back time? We could wipe all the sad moments away. But then, all the happy moments would vanish too.</li>
<li>Yearning for the times when my smile was real.</li>
<li>You can’t be lonely when you’ve always been alone in the first place.</li>
<li>All human souls are connected, which explains why it hurts so much to detach from others.</li>
<li>Bad things will always happen, and there’s absolutely nothing we can do about it.</li>
<li>Clouds let rain go when they get too heavy. The same is true for humans.</li>
<li>Crying is not a sign of weakness. Even strong people cry, especially when they’ve been strong for too long.</li>
<li>Don’t say goodbye. Goodbye is to leave, as to leave is to eventually forget.</li>
<li>Even the strongest feelings become void when disregarded and taken for granted.</li>
<li>Every person has a secret sorrow that the world doesn’t know about.</li>
<li>Feeling too much always ends in feeling nothing.</li>
<li>For the most part, it is by losing what we love that we learn how to appreciate them.</li>
<li>Gloomy birds still sing.</li>
<li>Grief will always be the price we’ll pay for love.</li>
<li>Happiness makes one enjoy the music. Sadness, on the other hand, makes one understand the lyrics.</li>
<li>Happiness would be meaningless if sadness didn’t exist.</li>
<li>In certain instances, happy memories hurt the most.</li>
<li>Letting go of the things you never had is actually the hardest thing to do.</li>
<li>Love is priceless, yet we often pay heavily for it.</li>
<li>Moving on will never be easy.</li>
<li>Occasionally, we fall in love with people we can’t have.</li>
<li>One should not spend a lifetime waiting to start living.</li>
<li>Our eyes can speak. It is almost always futile to try and hide our feelings.</li>
<li>Sadness is like an ocean. Frequently, we drown. But sometimes, we are forced to swim.</li>
<li>Some people seem to get all the sunshine. And some, all the shade.</li>
<li>Someone who overthinks is someone who overloves.</li>
<li>Sure, closing your eyes will shut away the things that you don’t want to see. But, closing your heart doesn’t mean you won’t feel anything anymore.</li>
<li>Tears are words that the heart can’t say.</li>
<li>The saddest thing is when you’re on the verge of breaking down, and you try to look for a shoulder to cry on, but there’s none.</li>
<li>Ultimately, we can only blame ourselves.</li>
<li>Unhappiness begins when one becomes too clingy and attached.</li>
<li>We create the shackles that we choose to wear in life.</li>
<li>We distance ourselves to keep the sadness away, but it also prevents the happiness from coming in.</li>
<li>Admit it, you’re waiting for something that has no chance of happening.</li>
<li>Alone, I feel sad. Amongst others, I feel even more sad.</li>
<li>Behind every “it’s okay” is a little pain.</li>
<li>Clowns need laughter too.</li>
<li>Do you ever think about your well-being and realize how not okay you are?</li>
<li>Drowning in a whirlpool of emotions.</li>
<li>Even my imaginary friends avoid me.</li>
<li>Every now and then, I just disappear. It’s kind of my thing, really.</li>
<li>Family and friends? I’ve got a lot of those! But why do I feel so alone?</li>
<li>Have you ever woken up pre-sad? It’s like nothing even happened yet, butyou’re already sad.</li>
<li>Here I am expecting too much from people again.</li>
<li>I loathe loneliness, but it loves me.</li>
<li>If people could step into my shoes, their hearts would immediately break.</li>
<li>If you threw a match at me, I'd probably explode.</li>
<li>It was when I woke up that the nightmare began.</li>
<li>Living, but no one notices.</li>
<li>Lost in a world that doesn’t exist.</li>
<li>Maybe it was as possible to succeed as a failure as it was to fail at succeeding.</li>
<li>My own expectations caused most of the pain I’ve ever experienced in my life.</li>
<li>Nothing like a tear running down a cheek.</li>
<li>Numb is my default mood.</li>
<li>Old memories sometimes creep out of my eyes and slip down my cheeks.</li>
<li>Smiling and trying to keep the tears from falling.</li>
<li>The world is falling apart, yet all I can do is stare blankly.</li>
<li>These are days where everyday clothes feel like weighted blankets.</li>
<li>To let go or to hold on? Which is more painful?</li>
<li>Welcome to my struggle.</li>
<li>What to do with all the sadness? Channel it and convert it into creative energy.</li>
<li>Whenever I’m sad, I just go to my favorite place—the fridge!</li>
<li>Where should I go? To the left where nothing is right, or to the right where nothing is left?</li>
<li>Who was it that dumped my dreams in a ditch? It was me.</li>
<li>Why is it raining despite the absence of clouds?</li>
<li>A day that doesn’t feel like I’m falling apart would be nice.</li>
<li>And then, I thought that maybe I was meant to be alone.</li>
<li>And suddenly, we were strangers again.</li>
<li>Beauty lies in everything but me.</li>
<li>Being alone isn’t really as bad as being with people who make you feel alone.</li>
<li>Deep inside, I’m hurting. But it’s okay. I’m used to it.</li>
<li>Did I lose a friend? Nope, I just realized I never had one.</li>
<li>Even a million tears won’t bring anything back.</li>
<li>Even when I was left all alone, I didn’t give up.</li>
<li>Feeling sad, but I still try to smile. That’s my life.</li>
<li>Help me before my heart gets too cold.</li>
<li>Hiding a thousand feelings behind the happiest smile.</li>
<li>How much more can I take?</li>
<li>I act like it isn’t a big deal, when really, I am breaking my heart.</li>
<li>I feel like I’m waiting for something that is never going to happen.</li>
<li>I hate that I’m still hoping.</li>
<li>I said I’m fine. But, am I really?</li>
<li>If only memories can be wiped as easily as tears.</li>
<li>In silence, no one answers.</li>
<li>It’s not like I can’t feel pain. It’s just that I can tolerate it much better.</li>
<li>It’s weird, but when I recall happy moments during my despairing moments, I get even sadder.</li>
<li>Keeping a lot to myself because it’s difficult to find people who understand.</li>
<li>Lord help my poor soul.</li>
<li>My mind is currently wandering in a dark and terrible place.</li>
<li>No one knows how much I cried that day.</li>
<li>No, I may not be physically alone. But mentally, there is no one in sight.</li>
<li>Not good enough. Never good enough.</li>
<li>Off to world where there are no disappointments and no expectations. Just alone.</li>
<li>People leave me like I am never a reason to stay.</li>
<li>Please don’t wake me up. I have a much better time when I’m asleep.</li>
<li>Please heal my wounded heart.</li>
<li>Promenading under the rain can be nice. After all, no one notices my tears.</li>
<li>Slowly fading away and no one is even noticing.</li>
<li>So why am I still hoping?</li>
<li>To tell you the truth, I’ve been avoiding everything.</li>
<li>Truth be told, I do care. But I’m done trying.</li>
<li>Weeping again, drunk on the impossible past.</li>
<li>Well, it doesn’t matter anymore.</li>
<li>Why do they always want me to be what I can’t become?</li>
<li>Why do people have to experience loneliness?</li>
</ul>
