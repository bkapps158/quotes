<ul><li>People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing.</li>

<li>If you think nothing is impossible, try slamming a revolving door.</li>

<li>I finally realized that people are prisoners of their phones&#8230; that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called a &#8220;cell&#8221; phone.&nbsp;</li>

<li>There are 100 billion nerves in the human body, and there are people who have the ability to irritate all of them.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Your secrets are safe with me&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t even listening.</li>

<li>You never realize what you have until it&#8217;s gone. Toilet paper is a good example.&nbsp;</li>

<li>I don&#8217;t think inside the box and I don&#8217;t think outside the box&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know where the box is.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Be careful when you follow the masses. Sometimes the M is silent.&nbsp;</li>

<li>I would like to thank my arms for always being by my side, my legs for always supporting me, and my fingers because I can always count on them.</li>

<li>Don&#8217;t be ashamed of who you are. That&#8217;s your parents&#8217; job.</li>

<li>It may look like I&#8217;m doing nothing, but in my head, I&#8217;m quite busy.&nbsp;</li>

<li>When people tell me &#8220;You&#8217;re going to regret that in the morning,&#8221; I sleep in until noon because I&#8217;m a problem solver.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Doing nothing is hard, you never know when you&#8217;re done.&nbsp;</li>

<li>If you fall, I will be there. Signed: Floor.</li>

<li>You can&#8217;t run through a campground. You can only &#8220;ran,&#8221; because it&#8217;s past tents.</li>

<li>Dear autocorrect, that&#8217;s not what I was trying to say. I&#8217;m getting tired of your shirt.</li>

<li>Out of my mind! Back in five minutes.&nbsp;</li>

<li>To make time fly, throw your watch out the window.&nbsp;</li>

<li>I don&#8217;t like violence but I don&#8217;t mind if I get hit by luck.</li>

<li>People say &#8220;go big or go home&#8221; like going home is a bad thing. Heck yeah, I want to go home, and I&#8217;ll have a nap when I get there.&nbsp;</li>

<li>He who laughs last didn&#8217;t get it.</li>

<li>It sure is strange that after Tuesday the rest of the week spells WTF. </li>

<li>Yes, I know there is a really special place in Hell for me. It is called a throne. </li>

<li>I eat cake because it&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s birthday somewhere. </li>

<li>My friend thinks he&#8217;s smart. He said onions are the only food that makes you cry. So I threw a coconut at his face.</li>

<li>Vodka may not be the answer but it’s worth a shot.</li>

<li>Wine + dinner = winner </li>

<li>I never make the same mistake twice. I make it like five or six times, you know, just to be sure. </li>

<li>Yesterday I really wanted tacos. Now I&#8217;m eating tacos. Follow your dreams. </li>

<li>I need a six-month vacation twice a year.</li>

<li>Praying to the algorithm gods.</li>

<li>That awkward moment when you&#8217;re wearing Nikes but you can&#8217;t do it.</li>

<li>Young, dumb, and broke.</li>

<li>The bags under my eyes are designer.</li>

<li> I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t take orders. I barely take suggestions. </li>

<li>You just can&#8217;t&nbsp;live a full life&nbsp;on an empty stomach.</li>

<li>Reality called, so I hung up.</li>

<li>I followed a diet but it didn’t follow me back, so I unfollowed it.</li>
